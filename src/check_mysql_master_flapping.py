"""InnoGames Monitoring Plugins - MySQL Master Flapping

This script is used to check if both loadbalancers have the same opinion about
which of our MySQL servers should serve the traffic. It uses data provided by
the mysqllbcheck tool which sets read/write states.

Whenever mysqllbcheck receives a query from the loadbalancer and determines the
local host should be master, it writes a timestamp to a table. As both of the
loadbalancers might not have the same opinion, both servers could be set to
write. This we then can see in the timestamps and use that for the detection.

When two or more servers write a heartbeat within <flapping_time_limit> seconds
it is considered as flapping. Be aware that a failover will likely trigger a
warning, depending how often the check is run and when the failover occured.
